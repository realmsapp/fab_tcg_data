  **Iyslander Specialization** _(You may only have Ice Eternal in
  your deck if your hero is Iyslander.)_

  **Ice Fusion** _(As an additional cost to play Ice Eternal, you may
  reveal an Ice card from your hand.)

  Create X Frostbite tokens under target hero's control. Then,
  if Ice Eternal was **fused**, deal arcane damage to that hero
  equal to the number of Frostbites they control.
