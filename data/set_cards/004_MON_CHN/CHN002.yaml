  Mentor (You may only have Sutcliffe in your deck if your hero is young.)

  At the start of your turn, if Sutcliffe is face down in your arsenal, you may turn him face up.

  Whenever you play a 'non-attack' action card, deal 1 arcane damage to each hero and put a lesson counter on Sutcliffe for each damage dealt this way. Then if there are 3 or more lesson counters on Sutcliffe, banish him, search your deck a specialization card, put it face up into your arsenal, and shuffle your deck.
