  Deal 3 arcane damage to target opposing hero.

  If Sonic Boom deals damage, look at the top card of your deck. If it's a Wizard 'non-attack' action card, you may banish it. If you do, you may play it this turn as though it were an instant and it costs X resource points less to play, where X is the damage dealt by Sonic Boom.
