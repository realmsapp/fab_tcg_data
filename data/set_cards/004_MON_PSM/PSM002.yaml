  Mentor (You may only have The Librarian in your deck if your hero is young.)

  At the start of your turn, if The Librarian is face down in your arsenal, you may turn him face up.

  Once per Turn Effect - Whenever you create a Spectral Shield token, draw a card and put a lesson counter on The Librarian. Then if there are 3 or more lesson counters on The Librarian, banish him, search your deck a specialization card, put it face up into your arsenal, and shuffle your deck.
