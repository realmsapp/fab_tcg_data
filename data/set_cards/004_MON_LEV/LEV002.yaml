  Mentor (You may only have Barthimont in your deck if your hero is young.)

  At the start of your turn, if Barthimont is face down in your arsenal, you may turn her face up.

  Whenever you play an attack action card, banish the top card of your deck. If the banished card has 6 or more [Power], the attack gains dominate and put a lesson counter on Barthimont. Then if there are 2 or more lesson counters on Barthimont, banish her, search your deck a specialization card, put it face up into your arsenal, and shuffle your deck.
