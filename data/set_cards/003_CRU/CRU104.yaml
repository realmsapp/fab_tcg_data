  Absorption Dome enters the arena with steam counters on it equal to the number of times you have **boosted** this turn.

  If you would be dealt damage, remove that many steam counters from Absorption Dome instead, then prevent damage equal to the number of steam counters removed in this way.

  When Absorption Dome has no steam counters on it, destroy it.
