  **Once per Turn Instant** - [Resource]: You may put an arrow card from your hand face up into an empty arsenal zone you control. If you do, choose 1;

  * It gains +1 [Power] until end of turn.
  * It gains **dominate** until end of turn. *(The defending hero can't defend the attack with more than 1 card from their hand.)*
