  Whenever you attack with Duskblade, if you've played an attack action card and a 'non-attack' action card this turn, put a +1 [Power] counter on Duskblade.

  At the beginning of your end phase, if you haven't played an attack action card and a 'non-attack' action card this turn, remove all +1 [Power] counters from Duskblade.
