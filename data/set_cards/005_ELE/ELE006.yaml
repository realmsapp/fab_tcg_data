  **Earth Fusion** *(As an additional cost to play Awakening, you may reveal an Earth card from your hand.)*

  If you have less [Life] than an opposing hero, create Seismic Surge tokens equal to the difference. If Awakening was **fused**, instead create twice that many Seismic Surge tokens.

  Search your deck for a Guardian attack action card with cost less than or equal to the number of Seismic Surge tokens you control, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your deck.
