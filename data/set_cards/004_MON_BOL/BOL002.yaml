  Mentor (You may only have Minerva in your deck if your hero is young.)

  At the start of your turn, if Minerva is face down in your arsenal, you may turn her face up.

  1H weapons you control have +1 [Power]. Whenever a weapon you control hits, put a lesson counter on Minerva. Then if there are 3 or more lesson counters on Minerva, banish her, search your deck a specialization card, put it face up into your arsenal, and shuffle your deck.
